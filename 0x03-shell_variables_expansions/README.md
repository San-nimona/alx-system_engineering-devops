Shell variable expansion is a feature in Unix/Linux shell scripting that allows you to substitute the value of a variable with its corresponding value during the execution of a command. This means that you can use variables to hold data, and then reference the variables in your scripts, rather than hardcoding the data directly into the script.

There are several types of variable expansions in shell scripting. The most common are the dollar sign ($) and curly braces ({}) expansions. The dollar sign is used to retrieve the value of a variable, while curly braces are used to specify the boundaries of the variable name.
